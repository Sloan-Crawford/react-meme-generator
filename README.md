**Notes**:

**_Props (Properties):_**

- Props are used to store data that can be accessed by the children of a React component.
- They are part of the concept of reusability. Props take the place of class attributes and allow you to create consistent interfaces across the component hierarchy.
- they pass data from one component to another.
